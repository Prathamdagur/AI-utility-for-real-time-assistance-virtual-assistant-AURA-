Hi! This is AURA (AI utility for real time assistance) that took me 3 months to build with many trial and errors, in this process of building I learned many libraries many extensions and what not. I would not say that I didn't use Chagpt ,  Gemini etc, But I used it to guide me not build the complete project , and to be realistic chatbots can not build an application by just simple prompts. It did help me to find my mistakes and guide me what step, inbuild library , external library, extensions would help me to create a particular function. Creating the model of AURA was not that challenging I took help of YouTube , python.org , and also Udemy python course that I bought for learning python, So I have quite strong hold on this language , creating the UI was bit challenging for me. I loved building AURA , your personal real time assistance and even I use it.

WORKING OF AURA: Things it can perform with examples 
1. Open applications close applications by speech recognition , example: open notepad/close notepad
2. Answer all your questions starting with what/how/who, example : who is Elon Musk, What is TCP, How does an induction motor starts 
3. It can search on command , example: search amazon (will search amazon on default browser)
4. Play anything on youtube by simply commanding it to "play python pectures on youtube"
5. Simple calculations , example: calculate 1999 times 199 minus 111
6. Can tell you current time and date
7. Add reminders and it also has a seperate window for the reminders and tasks , example : remind me to call dad, show reminders, clear reminders.
8. Can even type on command , example : open notepad/word and type project.
10. Basic conversations like greetings , tell you a joke/face , example: tell me a joke, how are you
11. It can undo a command by simply saying undo
12. It can look up wikipedia for you, example: wikipedia Galaxy
13. Tell you about the system info. command: system info 

I suggest you to try it yourself ! 
I have not used any chatbot to write this for me because I don't need it , I have worked with this project so I know it better than any chatbots. And honestly I don't know if this is how Github README works , since this is my first time. Thank you for reading :)
